This eclipse Android project demonstrates a simple JSON loader for the AndEngine 
based on Chris Campbell's Jb2dJson.java Jbox2d JSON Loader found at:

I did this so I could utilize Chris's R.U.B.E Box2D editor found here:

Check out the RUBE Editor and the demos, it's a very nice piece of software!

In this example (car.json) we can maneuver a small car across a test terrain

Check out a demo of what it looks like here:
